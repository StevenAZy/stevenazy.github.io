Here is **Changyong Li (Steven, 李昌永)**.

My name is Changyong Li, and I am currently a Research and Development Supervisor at a semiconductor company. Previously, I was pursuing a Doctorate in Control Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, with a focus on bioinformatics, under the supervision of Associate Professor [Xiaoyong Pan](https://xypan1232.github.io/). I left the PhD program in November 2025. Prior to that, I obtained a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Guilin University of Electronic Technology in 2022, where I worked with Professor [Yongxian Fan](https://dasegroup.github.io). I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Changzhou University in 2019, collaborating with Professor [Yi Zhang](https://cmee.cczu.edu.cn/2017/0410/c12130a154442/page.htm).
